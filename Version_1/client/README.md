<summary>## üì¶ Additional Dependencies</summary>

For a holistic frontend functionality in the SecureDataExchange application, we've integrated some pivotal dependencies:

### `react-router-dom`
- **What it does**: Enables dynamic routing in the application, vital for crafting intuitive navigation within single-page applications.

### `axios`
- **What it does**: An esteemed promise-driven HTTP client instrumental in making asynchronous requests in JavaScript, paramount for asynchronous HTTP requests to RESTful endpoints and curating CRUD operations.

### `react-cookie`
- **What it does**: Offers a seamless cookie management system within React, crucial for reading, setting, and managing cookies across components.

To seamlessly integrate these dependencies, execute:

```bash
yarn add react-router-dom axios react-cookie
