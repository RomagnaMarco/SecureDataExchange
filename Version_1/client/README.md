<summary>## üì¶ Additional Dependencies</summary>

For a holistic frontend functionality in the SecureDataExchange application, we've integrated some pivotal dependencies:

### `react-router-dom`
- **What it does**: Enables dynamic routing in the application, vital for crafting intuitive navigation within single-page applications.

### `axios`
- **What it does**: An esteemed promise-driven HTTP client instrumental in making asynchronous requests in JavaScript, paramount for asynchronous HTTP requests to RESTful endpoints and curating CRUD operations.

### `react-cookie`
- **What it does**: Offers a seamless cookie management system within React, crucial for reading, setting, and managing cookies across components.

### `jwt-decode`
- **What it does**: Facilitates decoding of JWTs, empowering the application to extract and use information stored in JSON Web Tokens. It's critical for user authentication and role-based access control within the application.

To seamlessly integrate these dependencies, execute:

```bash
yarn add react-router-dom axios react-cookie jwt-decode
```

### `Level 0`
- **Permissions**:
  - **GET**: Users can retrieve information.
- **Restrictions**: Certain sensitive information might be concealed or redacted.

### `Level 1`
- **Permissions**:
  - **GET**: Users can retrieve information.
  - **POST**: Users can add or submit new information.
